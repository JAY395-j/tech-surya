1. Project Introduction:
Objective: Define the goal of your analysis. For example, "The goal of this analysis is to explore and gain insights from a banking transaction dataset, understanding patterns, trends, and anomalies in customer behavior."
Dataset Overview: Briefly describe the dataset you are using, its source, and its features. For instance, "The dataset consists of transaction records of customers, including transaction amount, date, transaction type, customer demographics, and account balance."
2. Data Collection:
Data Source: Mention where the data comes from (e.g., Kaggle, bank simulation, etc.).
Size of Dataset: How many rows and columns are there? This helps to understand the scale.
Variables and Data Types: List out the main variables like transaction amount, customer ID, time of transaction, location, etc. Also, define the data types (integer, float, categorical, datetime, etc.).
3. Data Cleaning:
Missing Data: Identify any missing or incomplete values. Discuss strategies for handling missing data (imputation, removal, etc.).
Duplicate Entries: Check for duplicate rows and decide whether to remove them or keep them.
Outliers: Look for outliers in numeric columns (e.g., large transaction amounts).
Data Type Conversion: Ensure that all data is in the correct format for analysis (e.g., datetime variables are properly parsed).
4. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Use summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical variables. This helps understand the central tendency, spread, and skewness of the data.
Example: Analyze the distribution of transaction amounts across different customer segments.
Data Visualization: Create various plots to uncover insights and trends in the data.
Histograms: Show the distribution of transaction amounts, frequency of transactions over time, or customer age distribution.
Box Plots: Identify outliers in transaction amounts or customer account balances.
Bar Charts: Show the frequency of different transaction types (e.g., withdrawals, deposits).
Correlation Matrix: Explore relationships between variables (e.g., transaction amount vs. customer age).
Time Series Analysis: If the dataset has timestamp data, perform time series analysis. Explore trends over time, such as:
Frequency of transactions over days, weeks, or months.
Seasonal patterns (e.g., higher transactions at month-end).
Customer Segmentation: If demographic information is available, try to segment customers based on transaction behavior or other attributes (e.g., age, account balance).
5. Pattern Recognition:
Frequent Transactions: Identify customers who make frequent transactions, or recognize peak transaction times.
Transaction Type Trends: What types of transactions (e.g., withdrawals, deposits, transfers) are more common at different times or for specific customer segments?
Customer Behavior: Are there any noticeable patterns in spending or saving habits across customer demographics (e.g., age group, income bracket)?
6. Hypothesis Testing:
Questions to Answer: Example questions you might explore with hypothesis testing:
Are high-income customers more likely to make larger transactions?
Is there a significant difference in transaction frequency between weekdays and weekends?
Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to validate your assumptions.
7. Insights & Interpretation:
Findings: Summarize your key insights, such as trends in transaction frequency, high-value customer behavior, or potential areas of fraud (e.g., abnormal transaction sizes).
Recommendations: Based on the EDA, provide actionable insights. For example:
Banks could introduce special offers or discounts based on frequent transaction behavior.
Implementing fraud detection measures on large transactions or unusual patterns.
8. Conclusion:
Summary: Recap the findings from your analysis.
Future Steps: Suggest areas for further investigation or how predictive models (e.g., for fraud detection or customer retention) could be built using the insights gained from the EDA.
9. Tools Used:
Mention the libraries and tools you used for EDA, such as:
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Scipy: For hypothesis testing.
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive analysis and presentation.
